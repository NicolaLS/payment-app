# Rayl branding

`rails.svg` is the default Rayl app icon: four blue rays converging at one point.
`ray.svg` retains the alternate R concept. Both are editable, unmasked 1024-unit
vector sources supplied with the September 2026 branding pack. Named groups
separate the background, symbol, and lighting; gradients remain editable.

## Platform assets

- iOS: `../iosApp/iosApp/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png` is an
  opaque 1024 × 1024 RGB PNG. iOS supplies the rounded mask and automatic dark
  and tinted appearances.
- Android: `../androidApp/src/main/res/mipmap-*` contains lossless adaptive
  foreground/background layers and legacy launcher icons. The adaptive artwork
  maps to the central 72dp of the 108dp layer; its convergence point remains in
  the 66dp safe circle. The decorative rays extend beyond the mask for launcher
  motion. A separate vector of the four planes supports themed icons.
- Google Play: `../androidApp/src/main/ic_launcher-playstore.png` is the opaque,
  unmasked 512 × 512 export.

The rounded presentation exports, duplicate foreground SVGs, comparison sheet,
and standalone HTML preview from the delivery pack are omitted. The two vector
sources retain the editable artwork; installed platform assets are generated
from `rails.svg`.

## Regenerating icons

Run `export-icons.py` with Python, CairoSVG 2.9.1, Pillow 12.3.0, and native Cairo
installed (on macOS, Cairo is available through Homebrew). These are asset
authoring tools, not application dependencies. For example, from this directory:

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/rayl-icons-venv
/tmp/rayl-icons-venv/bin/pip install CairoSVG==2.9.1 Pillow==12.3.0
/tmp/rayl-icons-venv/bin/python export-icons.py
```

On macOS, if Python cannot locate Cairo, set
`DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="$(brew --prefix)/lib"` for the export command.
The exporter is specific to the four triangular rails and their existing SVG
layer structure. Revisit its layer separation and safe-zone placement when
changing that geometry. Inspect small sizes and circular launcher crops after
exporting.
