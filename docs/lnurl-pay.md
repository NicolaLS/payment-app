# LNURL-pay behavior

Rayl's Blink experience, Blip, and Lasr use the shared LNURL-pay client and
invoice resolver. Flint's Spark SDK has its own implementation; this document
does not describe its transport or validation.

LNURL-pay and Lightning addresses require public HTTPS hostnames. IP literals,
local hostnames, onion services, and DNS answers containing private, loopback,
link-local, multicast, or reserved addresses are rejected. Every initial
endpoint and callback is checked. HTTP redirects are rejected, including HTTPS
redirects; a service must provide its final endpoint directly. Callbacks can
use a different public HTTPS domain from the initial service.

DNS checks use the platform resolver before each request. The native HTTP
engine performs its own connection lookup, so these checks do not pin the DNS
answer to the connection and cannot completely prevent DNS rebinding. Normal
TLS certificate and hostname validation remains enabled. This is a mobile
client destination restriction, not a general-purpose SSRF-resistant proxy.
Well-known NAT64 addresses are accepted only when their embedded IPv4 address
is public.

Responses are streamed with a 256 KiB limit before UTF-8 decoding and JSON
parsing, with JSON nesting limited to 32 levels. The client requires the exact
`payRequest` tag, a public HTTPS callback,
positive integer sendable amounts in a valid range, and one usable `text/plain`
metadata entry. Unknown metadata types may carry non-string values as allowed
by [LUD-06](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md). Known metadata fields
must have the expected types. Remote error text and transport exceptions are
replaced with classified messages that do not include URLs or response bodies.

Amounts round upward to whole satoshis. Unrepresentable amounts, values outside
the advertised range, and rounding that would exceed that range are rejected
before requesting an invoice. The callback receives exactly one approved
`amount` and optional `comment`. Returned invoices must be unexpired, contain
the requested amount, and commit to the metadata hash or contain the exact
plaintext description; absent plaintext metadata never permits an arbitrary
invoice description.

The payment's domain and sanitized description are shown on amount entry and
confirmation screens by default. The existing LNURL setting still adds a review
before requesting an invoice for fixed amounts. It does not control whether
details appear in an otherwise-required confirmation. Existing Auto Pay limits,
manual-entry policy, preset-target confirmations, and deep-link confirmations
remain provider-owned. A fixed payment eligible for Auto Pay can proceed without
a review screen when the extra LNURL review setting is off.
